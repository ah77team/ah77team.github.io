        <p>My app is a launcher that supports the elderly, it needs the QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission to get all the apps currently on the phone.</p>
        <p>It will take the package id and icon, name of the application to display a few selected applications to make it easier for the elderly to use the phone.</p>
